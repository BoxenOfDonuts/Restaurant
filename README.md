# Restaurant
This project is from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/restaurant-page).

# Thoughts... :thinking:
The goal of this project was to use DOM maniuplation to dynamially reload the page, as well as the first project using npm and webpack. I got to learn about npm, and the files it uses, as well as modify the the files. I added build and watch scirpts, as well as create the webpack configuration. The project also required us to break out the invididual tab creations into their own files and import them into the 'main' javascript file to handle the event listners. While creating, I identified a factory functions used across all the files, so I made utility.js and imported them from there. Overall had a great time making the site, and learned a lot. I want to move along the track further, so I haven't optimized the site for mobile veiwing yet.
